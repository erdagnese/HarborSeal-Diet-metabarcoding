This script analyzes the error due to digestion bias in the controlled feeding study after correcting reads for the amplification bias and the tissue bias. 

This script does the following:
1. identifies the remaining bias in the controlled feeding study
2. determines corrections for the different groups of prey
3. applies the corrections to the controlled feeding results to confirm usage
4. applies the corrections to the wild scats to return a final fully corrected table of corrected reads
